# Description: 
#     Parameters for standalone debugging of the controller

# The command frequency rate (should be similar to actuator frequency)
frequency: 100

# This is the rate which state updates are sent back to the action server
# This doesn't need to be fast.
feedback_frequency: 10

# Monitoring/debugging frequency for full controller state publications.
# This won't impact runtime as it will only have an effect if there's
# a subscriber tuned in to the state topic.
state_frequency: 100

# Time to wait for controller to be ready after receiving a command (power be enabled)
enabled_timeout: 5.0

# Estimated processing time for the trajectory interpolation in seconds (used for merging)
estimated_interpolation_time: 0.1
