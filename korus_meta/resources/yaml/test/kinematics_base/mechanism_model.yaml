# MECHANISM MODEL
#
# Description: 
#     Configuration of the mechanism model. Actually, most of this is scattered
#     around the place, controllers, joints. Here is just the core node params.
#
# Note, if you change parameters here, make sure you change parameters in:
#
#  - urdf/korus.xacro (names, limits)
#  - yaml/mobile_base/diff_drive_base.yaml (wheel name strings)
#  - goo/*.yaml (names)

# frequency is in Hz. If < 0 the mechanism model will cowardly refuse to 
# publish at all. 
joint_state_publishing_frequency: 100

# Ordering for these groups is important as it is expected to match the inputs for the controllers/action servers.

  'all' : [ 'revolute_1', 'prismatic', 'revolute_2' ]
