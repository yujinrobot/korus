# MECHANISM MODEL
#
# Description: 
#     Configuration of the mechanism model. Actually, most of this is scattered
#     around the place, controllers, joints. Here is just the core node params.
#
# Note, if you change parameters here, make sure you change parameters in:
#
#  - urdf/korus.xacro (names, limits)
#  - yaml/mobile_base/diff_drive_base.yaml (wheel name strings)
#  - goo/*.yaml (names)

# frequency is in Hz. If < 0 the mechanism model will cowardly refuse to 
# publish at all. 
joint_state_publishing_frequency: 20

# Ordering for these groups is important as it is expected to match the inputs for the controllers/action servers.
# Only active ones are listed in the separate groupes (which are used among others by the controllers).
joint_groups:
  'all' : [ 'wheel_left', 'wheel_right' ]
  'base': [ 'wheel_left', 'wheel_right' ]


joints:
  'wheel_left': {
      transmission: direct,
      limit_min: -9999999.0,
      limit_max:  9999999.0,
      nominal_rate: 0.5,
