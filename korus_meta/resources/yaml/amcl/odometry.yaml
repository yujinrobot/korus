# Default values are in [] brackets (but always check on website).

# Which model to use, either "diff" or "omni" [diff]
odom_model_type: diff

# Specifies the expected noise in odometry's rotation estimate from the rotational component of the robot's motion [0.2]
odom_alpha1: 0.1
# Specifies the expected noise in odometry's rotation estimate from the translational component of the robot's motion [0.2]
odom_alpha2: 0.2
# Specifies the expected noise in odometry's translation estimate from the translational component of the robot's motion [0.2]
odom_alpha3: 0.2
# Specifies the expected noise in odometry's translation estimate from the rotational component of the robot's motion [0.2]
odom_alpha4: 0.1
# Translation-related noise parameter (only used if model is "omni") [0.2]
odom_alpha5: 0.2

# Which frame to use for odometry ["odom"]
odom_frame_id: /odom
# Which frame to use for the robot base ["base_link"]
base_frame_id: /base_footprint
# The name of the coordinate frame published by the localization system ["map"]
global_frame_id: /map

# Should amcl broadcast global_frame_id -> odom_frame_id?
