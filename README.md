Software for our mobile manipulation robot

For instructions on installation, testing & debugging and running the navigation or manipulation pipeline take a look at the wiki:

### Note

Most of the software here won't run without Yujin Robot's control software.
Few things however are useable as is, e.g. view the robot model and run the MoveIt! demo.
